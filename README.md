This is a utility to calculate Air Quality Index (AQI) with the input of concentration of the six main pollutants.

## Making Changes

To modify this code, edit the .ts files and then build.

### Building
```
yarn install
yarn build
```

### Testing
```
npm run test
```

Note that running tests this way only works when aqicalc-js isn't in the node_modules folder of another project.
